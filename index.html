    <div>
        <p>I studied photography design in <b>Bratislava</b> Slovakia. I specialise in <b>portrait</b> photography. <br>
        Even though I specialise in portrait photography I sometimes like to go out and do landscape photography too. </p>

        <p>After I finished school I've opened my photography studio in my hometown, and now sometimes later, <br> I've decided to take on a IT course
        to which I look fordward to. <br> It won't be easy, but I'm ready to do something much more different.</p>
